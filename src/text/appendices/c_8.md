### C.8: Reasoning with incomplete information ###

```{exercise} 8.1
Give the models of the program
  ```Prolog
  bird(tweety).
  ostrich(tweety).
  flies(X):-bird(X),not abnormal(X).
  abnormal(X):-ostrich(X).
  ```
(interpreting the general clause as the corresponding indefinite clause). Which one is the intended model (see section 2.4)?
```

The models are
```Prolog
{bird(tweety),ostrich(tweety),abnormal(tweety)}
{bird(tweety),ostrich(tweety),abnormal(tweety),
 flies(tweety)}
```
i.e. Tweety, being an ostrich, is an abnormal bird which may or may not fly. The intended model is the first one, since we have no reason to assume that ostriches fly.

```{exercise} 8.2
Give the models of the program
  ```Prolog
  likes(peter,S):-student_of(S,peter).
  student_of(paul,peter).
  ```
```

The Herbrand base of this program is
```Prolog
{likes(peter,peter),likes(peter,paul),
 likes(paul,peter),likes(paul,paul),
 student_of(peter,peter),student_of(peter,paul),
 student_of(paul,peter),student_of(paul,paul)}
```
The atoms `student_of(paul,peter)` and `likes(peter,paul)` are **true** in every model. If the atom `student_of(peter,peter)` is **true**, then so is the atom `likes(peter,peter)` (three possibilities). Disregarding the other four atoms, we obtain the following models:
```Prolog
{student_of(paul,peter),likes(peter,paul)}
{student_of(paul,peter),
 likes(peter,paul),likes(peter,peter)}
{student_of(paul,peter),student_of(peter,peter),
 likes(peter,paul),likes(peter,peter)}
```
Taking the four remaining atoms into account, we obtain $3*2^4=48$ models. (See also Exercise 2.6.)

```{exercise} 8.3
Apply Predicate Completion to the program
  ```Prolog
  wise(X):-not teacher(X).
  teacher(peter):-wise(peter).
  ```
```

The completion of this program is
$$
\forall \texttt{X: wise(X)} \leftrightarrow \neg \texttt{teacher(X)}
$$
$$
\forall \texttt{X: teacher(X)} \leftrightarrow \texttt{(X=peter} \land \texttt{wise(peter))}
$$
The first formula states that somebody is wise if and only if he is not a teacher; the second formula says that Peter is wise if and only if he is a teacher. Together, these two statements are inconsistent.
