# Trees as terms #

<!--section 1.3-->
Recall from {numref}`sec:1.3` that complex Prolog terms like
```Prolog
route(tottenham_court_road,route(leicester_square,noroute))
```
can be viewed as a tree, with the functor `route` acting as the root of (sub)trees, and `tottenham_court_road`, `leicester_square`, and `noroute` as leaves ({numref}`fig:1.6`). Conversely, trees can be represented by Prolog terms.

<!--section 3.7-->
A tree is traversed by first visiting its root, and then recursively traversing all of its subtrees. A list of subtrees is obtained by decomposing the complex term by means of the `=..` predicate (see {numref}`sec:3.7`):
```{swish} swish:4.1.1
```
By means of these simple predicates, we can write a program for finding arcs and paths in a tree. Paths are represented as lists of nodes, and an arc is simply a path consisting of two nodes:
```{swish} swish:4.1.2
---
inherit-id: swish:4.1.1
---

title: Data abstraction
---
The principle of *data abstraction* prescribes to keep datastructures local to specific predicates such as `term_tree`, `term_root` and `term_subtree`, and to access the datastructures only through these predicates. The main advantage of this design principle is *modularity*: if we choose to change the representation of a tree, we just have to modify these specific predicates, but the predicates which call them need not be changed. In contrast, if we unfold `term_tree`, `term_root` and `term_subtree` into the definition of `term_arc`, we get the following piece of code:
```Prolog
term_arc(Tree,[Root,R]):-
    Tree=..[Root|Subtrees].
    element(Subtree,Subtrees),
    Subtree=..[R|S].
term_arc(Tree,Arc):-
    Tree=..[Root|Subtrees].
    element(Subtree,Subtrees),
    term_arc(Subtree,Arc).
```
This program fragment is badly designed, because `term_arc` explicitly mentions the way trees are represented by Prolog terms. Consequently, if we change this representation, `term_arc` needs to be changed as well. This illustrates that the design of good datastructures is as important in Prolog as it is in any other programming language.

Consider the tree in {numref}`fig:4.2`. The following query lists all the paths in this tree:
```Prolog
?-term_path(n1(n2(n4,n5(n7),n6),n3(n8,n9(n10))),Path).
  Path = [1,2];
  Path = [1,3];
  Path = [2,4];
  Path = [2,5];
  Path = [2,6];
  Path = [5,7];
  Path = [3,8];
  Path = [3,9];
  Path = [9,10];
  Path = [1,2,4];
  Path = [1,2,5];
  Path = [1,2,6];
  Path = [1,2,5,7];
  Path = [1,3,8];
  Path = [1,3,9];
  Path = [1,3,9,10];
  Path = [2,5,7];
  Path = [3,9,10];
  No more solutions

It would be convenient to have a program for printing Prolog terms which represent trees in a tree-like way. The nicest way to do this is to print from the root down; however, this requires a rather elaborate program[^13_]. A reasonable alternative is to print the tree rotated at 90 degrees, from the root to the right. A program to do this is given below.
```{swish} swish:4.1.3
---
inherit-id: swish:4.1.1
---
```
`name/2`[^14_] is a built-in predicate, converting an atom into a list of ASCII-codes. In combination with `length/2`, it is used to determine the number of characters in an atom. The query `?-term_write(1(2(4,5(7),6),3(8,9(10))))` displays the tree as follows:
```Prolog
---------1---------2---------4
                    ---------5---------7
                    ---------6
          ---------3---------8
                    ---------9--------10
```

<!--Exercise 5.2-->
[^13_]: Such a program should perform breadth-first search; see {numref}`ex:5.2`.
[^14_]: From now on, we denote a `Predicate` with `Arity` as `Predicate/Arity`. This is because predicates with different arity are different predicates, even if they share the same predicate name.
