Draw the SLD-tree for the query `?-likes(A,B)`, given the following program:
```{swish} swish:3.2.ex3.3_2
```
Add a cut in order to prune away one of the answers $ \{ \texttt{A} \rightarrow \texttt{peter}, \texttt{B} \rightarrow \texttt{maria} \} $, and indicate the result in the SLD-tree. Can this be done without pruning away the third answer?
