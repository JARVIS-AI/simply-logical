        <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>This book grew out of the lecture notes I wrote for an undergraduate course on Artificial Intelligence Techniques at the Management Information Science department of Tilburg University. I am grateful to my students, on whom I tried several incomplete drafts and lousy exercises, and some of whom wrote messy programs that I had to rewrite completely before they could be incorporated in the book. It is because of them that the teachers in this book invariably like their students.</p>
<p>I would like to thank the Faculty of Economics and the Institute for Language Technology and Artificial Intelligence at Tilburg University, for providing the environment which made this book possible. I also thank my colleagues there for letting me work on the book (and sometimes not). The Jo&#x17E;ef Stefan Institute in Ljubljana was a very stimulating working place during a hot month in the Summer of &#8217;93.</p>
<p>Of the many people who contributed to this book, I can only name a few. Bob Kowalski&#8217;s enthusiastic response to my bold request was more than I could hope for. Nada Lavra&#x10D; and Luc De Raedt both worked their way through a draft manuscript and provided many useful suggestions. I have to apologise to Igor Mozeti&#x10D;, who provided the inspiration for the diagnosis example in section 8.3, but was unhappy with the outcome. The people at John Wiley were very helpful &mdash; I particularly like to thank Rosemary Altoft, Roslyn Meredith and Erica Howard for rescuing the London Underground map by obtaining copyright from London Regional Transport. The pictures in the Stuttgart Staatsgalerie were shot by Yvonne Kraan, Robert Meersman, and Jan van Schoot.</p>
<p>A final word of gratitude to the mysterious &#8216;Maria&#8217;, who is Peter&#8217;s student in so many examples. In a certain sense, the opposite would have been more appropriate.</p>
