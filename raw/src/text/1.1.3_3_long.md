For user-defined functors, such a linear notation is not available. However, Prolog provides a built-in &lsquo;datatype&rsquo; called *lists*, for which both the tree-like notation and the linear notation may be used. The functor for lists is `.` (dot), which takes two arguments: the first element of the list (which may be any object), and the rest of the list (which must be a list). The list terminator is the special symbol `[]`, denoting the empty list. For instance, the term

```Prolog
.(a,.(b,.(c,[])))
```

denotes the list consisting of `a` followed by `b` followed by `c` (fig. 1.7). Alternatively, we may use the linear notation, which uses square brackets:

```Prolog
[a,b,c]
```

To increase readability of the tree-like notation, instead of

```Prolog
.(First,Rest)
```

one can also write

```Prolog
[First|Rest]
```

Note that `Rest` is a list: e.g., `[a,b,c]` is the same list as `[a|[b,c]]`. `a` is called the *head* of the list, and `[b,c]` is called its *tail*. Finally, to a certain extent the two notations can be mixed: at the head of the list, you can write any number of elements in linear notation. For instance,

```Prolog
[First,Second,Third|Rest]
```

denotes a list with three or more elements.
