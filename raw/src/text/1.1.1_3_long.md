The resolution proof process makes use of a technique that is known as *reduction to the absurd*: suppose that the formula to be proved is false, and show that this leads to a contradiction, thereby demonstrating that the formula to be proved is in fact true. Such a proof is also called a *proof by refutation*. For instance, if we want to know which stations are nearby Tottenham Court Road, we negate this statement, resulting in &lsquo;there are no stations nearby Tottenham Court Road&rsquo;. In logic, this is achieved by writing the statement as a rule with an empty conclusion, i.e. a rule for which the truth of its premises would lead to falsity:

```Prolog
:-nearby(tottenham_court_road,W)
```

Thus, the symbols &lsquo; `?-` &rsquo; and &lsquo; `:-` &rsquo; are in fact equivalent. A contradiction is found if resolution leads to the empty rule, of which the premises are always true (since there are none), but the conclusion is always false. Conventionally, the empty rule is written as &lsquo; &#9633; &rsquo;.
