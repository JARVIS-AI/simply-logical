The recursive nature of such datastructures makes it possible to ignore the size of the objects, which is extremely useful in many situations. For instance, the definition of a route between two underground stations does not depend on the length of the route; all that matters is whether there is an intermediate station or not. For both cases, there is a clause. Expressing the route as a list, we can state the final definition of the reachability relation:

{{ code['1.2.3'] }}

The query `?-reachable(oxford_circus,charing_cross,R)` now results in the following answers:

```text
{ R → [tottenham_court_road,leicester_square] }
{ R → [piccadilly_circus] }
{ R → [piccadilly_circus, leicester_square] }
```

Note that Prolog writes out lists of fixed length in the linear notation.
