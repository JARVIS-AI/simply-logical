In Prolog, however, recursion is the **only** looping structure{{ footnote['1'] }}. (This does not necessarily mean that Prolog is always less efficient than a procedural language, because there are ways to write recursive loops that are just as efficient as iterative loops, as we will see in section 3.6.) Perhaps the easiest way to think about recursion is the following: an arbitrarily large chain is described by describing how one link in the chain is connected to the next. For instance, let us define the relation of *reachability* in our underground example, where a station is reachable from another station if they are connected by one or more lines. We could define it by the following 20 ground facts:

{{ code['1.1.1'] }}

Since any station is reachable from any other station by a route with at most two intermediate stations, we could instead use the following (non-recursive) definition:

```Prolog
reachable(X,Y):-connected(X,Y,L).
reachable(X,Y):-connected(X,Z,L1),connected(Z,Y,L2).
reachable(X,Y):-connected(X,Z1,L1),connected(Z1,Z2,L2),
                connected(Z2,Y,L3).
```

Of course, if we were to define the reachability relation for the entire London underground, we would need a lot more, longer and longer rules. Recursion is a much more convenient and natural way to define such chains of arbitrary length:

{{ code['1.1.2'] }}

The reading of the second rule is as follows: &lsquo; *Y* is reachable from *X* if *Z* is directly connected to *X* via line *L*, and *Y* is reachable from *Z* &rsquo;.
