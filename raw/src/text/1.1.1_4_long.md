At the beginning of this section, we posed the question: can we show that our two definitions of the nearby-relation are equivalent? As indicated before, the idea is that to be equivalent means to provide exactly the same answers to the same queries. To formalise this, we need some additional definitions. A *ground* fact is a fact without variables. Obviously, if `G` is a ground fact, the query `?-G` never returns a substitution as answer: either it *succeeds* (`G` does follow from the initial assumptions), or it *fails* (`G` does not). The set of ground facts `G` for which the query `?-G` succeeds is called the *success set*. Thus, the success set for our first definition of the nearby-relation consists simply of those 16 formulas, since they are ground facts already, and nothing else is derivable from them. The success set for the second definition of the nearby-relation is constructed by applying the two rules to the ground facts for connectedness. Thus we can say: two definitions of a relation are (procedurally) *equivalent* if they have the same success set (restricted to that relation).
