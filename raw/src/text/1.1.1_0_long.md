A *query* like &lsquo;which station is nearby Tottenham Court Road?&rsquo; will be written as

```Prolog
?-nearby(tottenham_court_road,W).
```

where the prefix &lsquo; `?-` &rsquo; indicates that this is a query rather than a fact. An *answer* to this query, e.g. &lsquo;Leicester Square&rsquo;, will be written { `W` &rarr; `leicester_square` }, indicating a *substitution* of values for variables, such that the statement in the query, i.e.

```Prolog
?-nearby(tottenham_court_road,leicester_square).
```

is true. Now, if the nearby-relation is defined by means of a list of facts, answers to queries are easily found: just look for a fact that *matches* the query, by which is meant that the fact and the query can be made identical by substituting values for variables in the query. Once we have found such a fact, we also have the substitution which constitutes the answer to the query.
