Finally, we illustrate the way Prolog can handle more complex datastructures, such as a list of stations representing a route. Suppose we want to redefine the reachability relation, such that it also specifies the intermediate stations. We could adapt the non-recursive definition of `reachable` as follows:

```Prolog
reachable0(X,Y):-connected(X,Y,L).
reachable1(X,Y,Z):-connected(X,Z,L1),
                   connected(Z,Y,L2).
reachable2(X,Y,Z1,Z2):-connected(X,Z1,L1),
                       connected(Z1,Z2,L2),
                       connected(Z2,Y,L3).
```

The suffix of reachable indicates the number of intermediate stations; it is added to stress that relations with different number of arguments are really different relations, even if their names are the same. The problem now is that we have to know the number of intermediate stations in advance, before we can ask the right query. This is, of course, unacceptable.
