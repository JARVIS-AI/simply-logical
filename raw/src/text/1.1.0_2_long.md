We now have two definitions of the nearby-relation, one which simply lists all pairs of stations that are nearby each other, and one in terms of direct connections. Logical formulas of the first type, such as

```Prolog
nearby(bond_street,oxford_circus)
```

will be called *facts*, and formulas of the second type, such as

```Prolog
nearby(X,Y):-connected(X,Z,L),connected(Z,Y,L)
```

will be called *rules*. Facts express unconditional truths, while rules denote conditional truths, i.e. conclusions which can only be drawn when the premises are known to be true. Obviously, we want these two definitions to be *equivalent*: for each possible query, both definitions should give exactly the same answer. We will make this more precise in the next section.
