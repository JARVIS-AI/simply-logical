We can now use this recursive definition to prove that Leicester Square is reachable from Bond Street (fig. 1.3). However, just as there are several routes from Bond Street to Leicester Square, there are several alternative proofs of the fact that Leicester Square is reachable from Bond Street. An alternative proof is given in fig. 1.4. The difference between these two proofs is that in the first proof we use the fact

```Prolog
connected(oxford_circus,tottenham_court_road,central)
```

while in the second proof we use

```Prolog
connected(oxford_circus,piccadilly_circus,bakerloo)
```

There is no reason to prefer one over the other, but since Prolog searches the given formulas top-down, it will find the first proof before the second. Thus, the order of the clauses determines the order in which answers are found. As we will see in Chapter 3, it sometimes even determines whether any answers are found at all.
