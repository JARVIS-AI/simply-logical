The first three chapters of the book are devoted to an introduction to Logic Programming. Chapter 1, *A brief introduction to clausal logic*, is an introductory chapter, introducing many concepts in Logic Programming by means of examples. These concepts get a more formal treatment in Chapter 2, *Clausal logic and resolution: theoretical backgrounds*. In Chapter 3, *Logic Programming and Prolog*, we take a closer look at Prolog as a logic programming language, explaining its main features and describing some common programming techniques.
