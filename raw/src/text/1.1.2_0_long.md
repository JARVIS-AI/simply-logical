Until now, we have encountered two types of logical formulas: facts and rules. There is a special kind of rule which deserves special attention: the rule which defines a relation in terms of itself. This idea of &lsquo;self-reference&rsquo;, which is called *recursion*, is also present in most procedural programming languages. Recursion is a bit difficult to grasp, but once you&rsquo;ve mastered it, you can use it to write very elegant programs, e.g.

```text
IF N=0<br>
THEN FAC:=1<br>
ELSE FAC:=N*FAC(N-1).
```

is a recursive procedure for calculating the factorial of a given number, written in a Pascal-like procedural language. However, in such languages *iteration* (looping a pre-specified number of times) is usually preferred over recursion, because it uses memory more efficiently.
