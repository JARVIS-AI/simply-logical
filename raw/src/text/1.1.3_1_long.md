We can solve this problem by means of *functors*. A functor looks just like a mathematical function, but the important difference is that *functor expressions are never evaluated to determine a value*. Instead, they provide a way to name a complex object composed of simpler objects. For instance, a route with Oxford Circus and Tottenham Court Road as intermediate stations could be represented by

```Prolog
route(oxford_circus,tottenham_court_road)
```

Note that this is not a ground fact, but rather an argument for a logical formula. The reachability relation can now be defined as follows:

{{ code['1.2.1'] }}

{{ code['1.2.2'] }}

The query `?-reachable(oxford_circus,charing_cross,R)` now has three possible answers:

```text
{ R → route(piccadilly_circus) }
{ R → route(tottenham_court_road,leicester_square) }
{ R → route(piccadilly_circus,leicester_square) }
```

{{ figure['1.6'] }}
