Should we for some reason want to know from which station Charing Cross can be reached via a route with four intermediate stations, we should ask the query

```Prolog
?-reachable(X,charing_cross,[A,B,C,D])
```

which results in two answers:

```text
{ X → bond_street , A → green_park , B → oxford_circus , C → tottenham_court_road , D → leicester_square }
{ X → bond_street , A → green_park , B → oxford_circus , C → piccadilly_circus , D → leicester_square }.
```
